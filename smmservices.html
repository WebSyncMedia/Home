                <p class="section2-title2 hideme">Social Media In Today’s World</p>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">Social media has taken the world by storm since its original creation. The amount of social media 
                    users has risen up to over 4 billion (which will be double what it was in 2015!). On average, people have at least 8 
                    different social media accounts and  they don’t just have them, they’re using them! Big platforms like Facebook saw well 
                    over half of their monthly users using Facebook daily in some of the latest data. The volume of people using social 
                    media, however, is not the only thing that’s changed.</div>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">The way people use social media has changed as well! It was originally created as a way for 
                    friends and family to communicate and socialize online, but it has become so much more than that. In today’s world, 
                    yes the main use remains to be interacting with friends and family, but it’s also an opportunity for brands and 
                    consumers or leads to connect. Listen to these recent statistics. 71% of consumers who had a positive social media 
                    experience with a brand were likely to recommend it to other people, and 21% of consumers are more likely to buy from 
                    brands that they can reach on social media. Social media platforms have started doubling as ecommerce platforms 
                    and/or as a major step in your marketing funnel for building connections.</div>
                
                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">So if you’re new to social media, what you need to understand as a business owner is that at its 
                    core social media is a place for people to connect with friends, family and brands alike. And as it continues to grow at 
                    an explosive rate you’ll want to take advantage of it for your business. That’s where social media marketing services 
                    come in.</div>

                <p class="section2-title2 hideme">What Is Social Media Marketing?</p>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">Social media marketing is the use of social media to increase brand awareness, build a 
                    targeted following, drive website traffic and ultimately increase your sales. Social media marketing for small 
                    businesses and entrepreneurs gives them the ability to establish their brand and online presence on platforms where 
                    their target audience is already scrolling.</div>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">All of that sounds pretty good right? So where do you start? Well, some of the social media 
                    platforms you can use to do this are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest.</div>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">The important thing to know is that there are two parts to social media marketing: organic social 
                    media management, which you will read about on this page and paid social media advertising services which you can click 
                    there to read more about.</div>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">The way to best decide how to go about your social media marketing plan is to first decide 
                    what your business goals and marketing goals are and what you would like to get out of social media marketing. So 
                    let’s talk a little more about that below.</div>

                <p class="section2-title2 hideme">How Can A Social Media Marketing Campaign Help My Business?</p>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">A social media marketing campaign helps you put strategic social media content and/or 
                    social ads in front of your targeted audience. This gives your business valuable, extensive and targeted exposure.</div>

                <p class="section2-title1 hideme">The Difference Between Social Media Marketing & Digital Marketing In General?</p>

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">We get this question a lot! The short answer is that social media marketing is one of the

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">So as you can see, social media marketing is just one working component under a bigger

                <div class="section2-text1 hideme">If you have been using social media for a while now, you’ve probably seen and interacted

                    like engaging with brands they favor and trust. But how do you create that brand-consumer trust?</div>
