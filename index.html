                        <div class="section3-text1">75% of opinions on website credibility come from web design
                        When users look at your site, they determine if you’re credible based on your design. So, if your current design is 
                        outdated, visitors won’t see you as trustworthy and will shy away from your site.</div>

                        <div class="section3-text1">A website that delivers a positive experience with great design, however, keeps
                        people engaged on your site. Not only will you draw them in with a visually appealing site, but you will have a 
                        website that’s functional and easy for your audience to use. This improved design will lead to more engagement and 
                        sales for your business.</div>
