                        How can web design improve sales, exactly? Let’s look at a few statistics that show the impact of design on sales:</div>
                        
                        <div class="section3-text1">75% of opinions on website credibility come from web design
                        When users look at your site, they determine if you’re credible based on your design. So, if your current design is 
                        outdated, visitors won’t see you as trustworthy and will shy away from your site.</div>
                        
                        <div class="section3-text1">That causes you to miss out on sales for your business. When you revamp your website’s 
                        design, you improve your site’s credibility. A clean and modern website will make visitors feel comfortable browsing 
                        or shopping on your page.</div>

                        Start by looking at how your website’s design affects the user’s experience.</div>

                        <div class="section3-text1">A website that delivers a positive experience with great design, however, keeps
                        people engaged on your site. Not only will you draw them in with a visually appealing site, but you will have a 
                        website that’s functional and easy for your audience to use. This improved design will lead to more engagement and 
                        sales for your business.</div>

                        <div class="section3-text1">38% of people stop engaging with a website if it’s unattractive. If your website 
                        isn’t visually appealing, people will stop engaging with it. Your audience wants to interact with sites that are 
                        visually appealing and catch their attention.</div>

                        <div class="section3-text1">An outdated website can cause people to leave, which means they won’t turn into a sale for

                        business, we’ll then go on to create content for your social media platforms.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">The amount of content we create depends on the plan you’ve signed up for, but in general
                        we create copy and an image (or video) to accompany that copy for every post.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">The call to actions we include in the copy will vary depending on which social media platforms 
                        you’re publishing on. For example, Instagram does not allow links in the copy, so we usually refer to the link in the bio. 
                        Twitter has a stricter character limit than other platforms, so we adjust your copy there accordingly.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">Additionally, if you sign up for a social media platform like Instagram, we can create
                        additional copy for features that are specific to the app, like Instagram Stories.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">As far as the imagery that publishes with the copy, we can use graphics, GIFs and
                        videos alike.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">The main point here is that we create content that specifically based on the data we find
                        in researching your business.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text1">We use that knowledge to create copy and graphics that will attract the attention of your
                        target audience and stand out from the competition.</div>

                        true! But it can get tricky when you’re rolling out a pre-planned monthly calendar. </div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">No small business owner has the time to manually, individually publish a social media
                        post with well-thought-out hashtags across multiple platforms, several times a day.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Doing so would not only deplete you of your time, but it would also leave more room for
                        spelling and grammatical errors.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">We understand that! That’s why we take publishing off your hands too.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">We create content calendars for our clients a month in advance, and then we use our publishing
                        and analytics software to schedule out the entire month’s worth of content in one sitting.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">This allows us to ensure no errors are made in the posts, it saves you (and us!) time, allowing
                        us to focus on other aspects of your marketing, and it allows your social media followers to expect regular posts from

                        every tweet and post, there is an advertising platform that allows you to put money behind your content.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">You can either “boost” your existing social media posts, or you can create completely new social
                        media ads to run.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Either way, social media advertising essentially allows you to put your content, brand and
                        website in front of more people within your target audience, faster.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Depending on what your business goals and social media goals are, there are several different 
                        types of ad campaigns we can suggest. They vary by objective.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Whether you need to drive traffic to your website, drive direct sales on your website, drive lead
                        conversions on your website, or simply increase your social media followers and engagement, social media advertising can
                        help you achieve it all.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Our social media ad specialists are experienced and capable of executing any ad campaign you need
                        or that we deem best fit for your business.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">The reason so many business owners aren’t super familiar with social media advertising is because
                        it can get a little technical in setting it all up.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">In order to track how many sales and conversions you’re receiving from your social media efforts,
                        you have to set up tracking pixels that connect your social advertising accounts to your website.</div>
                    
                    <div class="section5-text2">This is where it helps to have digital marketing experts who do this every day (like us!) come
                        in and take this task off your hands.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">We can make sure your ad campaigns are strategically set up from concept to execution.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">You may have heard it said a few times that digital marketing cannot succeed with a “set it and
                        forget it” strategy.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">That’s because the online landscape changes every minute of every day, and that includes social 
                        media!</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">It’s important to remember that “the internet” is composed of real humans whose opinions and 
                        buying behaviors are constantly changing and being influenced.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">That’s why we include social media monitoring with our social media services.</div>

                    <div class="section5-text2">Whether you sign up for our social media management services, social media advertising

                    <div class="section6-text1">As we’ve said, we talk about being a social media marketing company a lot because it’s what
                        we were founded on and therefore what we’re most known for. But it is not the only digital marketing service we offer!
                        The truth is our team is seasoned in all of the digital marketing services we provide (otherwise we wouldn’t offer them!).
                        Beyond social media marketing, this includes SEO, PPC, email marketing, graphic design and more.</div>

                    <div class="section6-text1">Having began as a total startup in the beginning, we understand all of the obstacles, hardships 
                        and challenges small business owners face. While we’ve grown tremendously since we were first founded, we have never 
                        (and will never) forget what it is like to be a small business owner juggling everything just trying to grow. It’s not 
                        small feat, but we’re thankful for our journey because it causes us to put a bigger emphasis on anticipating your needs 
                        and meeting them with our services. Whether you’ve dabbled a little bit on digital marketing but need help, understand 
                        digital marketing but don’t have the time to execute it properly or don’t know the first thing about digital marketing 
                        and the internet, we are here to meet you right where you are and get your business growing.</div>

                        dentistry, ecommerce, law, food and hospitality, real estate and many more. Working with a digital marketing team that 
                        already has experience helping others in your industry succeed can you give peace of mind that we know what we’re 
                        doing not just in digital marketing, but specifically in marketing within your field of work. We still complete 
                        thorough research on your specific business and competition and such because no two businesses are the same, but 
                        being well-versed in countless industries definitely makes things more efficient and effective for us in marketing 
                        your business! Why would you settle for an average, cookie cutter marketing approach when you can work with an 
                        agency that has already carved a path to success within your specific industry? Trust LYFE Marketing to garner the 
                        results you’re looking for.</div>

                    <div class="section6-text1">Whether you work with a smaller boutique marketing agency or a huge corporation to market your 
                        business, either way business owners often experience the fear of not being a priority. Smaller agencies often bite off 
                        more than they can chew, stretch themselves thin trying to serve as many clients as they can and provide you with 
                        mediocre service as a result. You may run into unreasonably long turnaround times, or receive poorly-executed work in 
                        this case. Oppositely, to bigger, corporate marketing chains you run the risk of being another client to them: another 
                        number to perform the same cardboard marketing efforts for. Not to mention larger agencies can afford to charge you an 
                        arm and leg for strategies that (in our opinion) don’t warrant the cost. That’s why we created LYFE Marketing with you 
                        in mind. We’re aware of the struggles listed (and not listed!) here that you as the business owner endure when looking 
                        for the perfect digital marketing agency to represent you. Your business is your baby, we get it! You want to partner 
                        with an expert company that is going to care about your business and your growth as much as you do, and this is exactly 
                        what you get when you partner with LYFE Marketing. You believe in the products and services you provide, and we believe 
                        in you. That’s why we center all of our marketing services, our pricing and our team around providing the best service 
                        and results possible at a rate small business owners can afford. If you’re ready to take your online presence by the

                            <div class="section7-text2">What do your online reviews look like right now? Do you have any? Or do you know 
                                whether you have any or not? If so, how have you handled them so far? Sometimes, small business owners make 
                                the mistake of placing lesser importance on their online reviews because they don’t think their business 
                                is “big enough” yet for them to matter much. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Listen to this: 
                                91% of 18-34 year olds trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Plus, 93% of consumers 
                                say that online reviews influenced their purchasing decisions. Lastly, 89% of marketers are showing that 
                                influencer marketing (a concept where social media users are influenced by social media figures with high 
                                followers) is providing a higher ROI than most other channels. So clearly, your reputation, what people 
                                say about you online and online reviews all matter a lot because the data that’s out there today shows us 
                                that your online reviews have a direct impact on your sales! This is why when you’re a client of LYFE 
                                Marketing, we take special care to monitor and respond to all of your online reviews, good or bad. Our 
                                experts are trained in damage control should you ever receive severely negative reviews, and oppositely 
                                we know how to foster positive reviews as well.</div>

                                with, it’s important to choose an expert team to assist you, but it’s equally important to choose a team 
                                that cares about your business. That’s why LYFE Marketing gives you the best of both worlds in that aspect. 
                                Simply executing general digital marketing techniques is not enough; it’s imperative that the marketing team 
                                acting on your behalf extensively understands your business, your goals, your industry, your competitors 
                                and your target audience. LYFE Marketing was founded by 3 men with a dream; we know firsthand what kind of 
                                care, attention and hard work it takes to raise a small business from the ground up. It’s having this 
                                experience coupled with our expertise in digital marketing and passion for helping other businesses grow

                            <div class="section7-text2">You probably hear the term “brand awareness” a good bit. A lot of marketers talk 
                                about how increased brand awareness is a positive thing and you need more of it… but what is it really? 
                                What does increasing your brand awareness really look like and how does it impact your business? Oxford 
                                Languages describes brand awareness as, “the extent to which consumers are familiar with the distinctive 
                                qualities or image of a particular brand of goods or services.” In other words, people can’t buy from you 
                                if they don’t know you exist. And to take it a step further, people won’t buy from you if they know who 
                                you are but don’t trust you. While a big part of digital marketing is all about metrics and data and about 
                                measuring website clicks and conversion rates, something that’s equally important but sometimes harder to 
                                track is how people feel about your business. Once people become familiar with your business, do they 
                                associate your brand with positive or negative thoughts in their brain? Was the experience that led to 
                                them learning of your brand in the first place a good one or a bad one? Brand awareness should exist at 
                                the top of your marketing funnel to ensure two things: 1) that you acquire consistent, qualified new 
                                leads and followers and 2) that they enter your funnel with a positive outlook on your brand. This is 
                                one aspect of digital marketing that LYFE Marketing puts a special focus on.</div>

                            <div class="section7-text2">What good do social ads and website traffic do if all your efforts never lead to 
                                any sales? Whether you’re using social ads or Google ads, getting your advertisements launched is only 
                                half the battle (and even that can take a lot of technical know how!). Beyond setting your ads up within 
                                the native advertising platform, you also have to install a conversion tracking pixel on your website 
                                from every ad platform you intend to use. The conversion pixel is what allows you to see how many sales 
                                or lead form completions have happened on your website as a direct result of your social or Google ads. 
                                The instructions for installing it vary by ad platform as well as by the type of website you have. This 
                                is where having a digital marketing expert at your side takes the headache out of the process! We do 
                                this countless times a day and can breeze right through this process for you- but like we mentioned 
                                above, that’s only half the battle! After your ads are set up correctly and launched, what happens if 
                                you still fail to generate sales from them? This is where conversion optimization comes in. Our team is 
                                skilled in analyzing your campaign for areas of opportunity and looking at the data of any results 
                                received so far (including impressions, clicks, engagement etc.) to make informed decisions with your 
                                campaign moving forward. If your campaign is not receiving strong results, there are often things that 
                                can be changed and optimized to get the ball rolling. Other agencies may “set it and forget it” as we 
                                say, but not LYFE Marketing!</div>
